The Employee Management System is a comprehensive project featuring distinct profiles for both employees and administrators. Admins have access to additional functionalities including category management, employee addition, employee removal, and granting access permissions to other employees.

Key Features:
- **Employee and Admin Profiles:** The system distinguishes between two user roles - employees and administrators. Each profile has its specific set of access and functionalities.
  
- **Admin Privileges:**
  - **Category Management:** Admins can create, modify, or delete different categories relevant to the system's operations. These categories might include departments, roles, or project groups.
  - **Employee Addition:** Admins have the authority to add new employees to the system, including their personal and professional details.
  - **Employee Deletion:** The admin has the capability to remove employee profiles when necessary.
  - **Access Control:** Admins can assign or revoke specific access permissions to employees based on their roles or responsibilities within the organization.

- **Employee Profile:**
  - Employees can access their personal information, view assigned tasks, and update their details as required.
  - Depending on permissions granted by the admin, employees may have limited or full access to various system features.

- **Security Measures:**
  - The system implements robust security measures to safeguard sensitive employee and company data.
  - Access control mechanisms ensure that employees only have access to the functionalities pertinent to their roles.

- **Data Management:**
  - The system maintains a database, i.e mySql, to store employee details, categories, access permissions, and other relevant information.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - The interface is designed for ease of use, employing intuitive navigation and clear instructions for both admins and employees.

This Employee Management System streamlines administrative tasks for handling employee data, access control, and category management while providing employees with a platform to manage their profiles within the organization.
